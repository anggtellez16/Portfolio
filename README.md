# Angelica Tellez - Portfolio

## About 

Hi, I'm Angelica! I am currently on track to completing my degree in Applied Mathematics (BS) and Computer Science (AS). I have developed a strong foundation in coding and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I look forward to bringing my technical and analytical skills to the data science field as a data specialist.  

During my studies, I developed a strong ability to analyze complex data, identifying patterns and trends with precision. I also gained hands-on experience in research techniques, data management, and statistical analysis—skills that will serve me well in my role as a data specialist.  

Beyond academics, I am passionate about exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, constantly seeking opportunities to expand my expertise. I thrive on uncovering valuable insights and using data to solve complex problems.

## Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Brewing Recommendations: A Data-Driven Approach to Coffee Recommendations Using Linear Algebra

**Code**: [Brewing Recommendations.ipynb](https://github.com/anggtellez16/Portfolio/blob/main/Brewing_Recommendations.ipynb)

**Presentation**: [Brewing Reccomendations Poster](https://github.com/anggtellez16/Portfolio/blob/main/Brewing%20Reccomendations%20Poster.pdf)

**Goal**: The goal of this research is to apply linear algebra concepts to develop a personalized coffee recommendation system that translates individual preferences into tailored selections, demonstrating the practical use of mathematical models in everyday decision-making.

**Description**: This project explores the application of linear algebra to develop a personalized coffee recommendation system based on individual preferences. We created a mathematical model that uses these preferences to recommend five coffee beans tailored to specific users. Through this research, we demonstrate how linear algebra concepts (such as the dot product, vector normalization) can inform everyday choices, down to the specific coffee we enjoy. In the future, we aim to gather real user data to refine the model, ideally generating accurate recommendations with even fewer inputs.

**Skills**: data cleaning, data analysis, and correlation matrices.

**Technology**: Python, Pandas, and Numpy.

**Source**: This project utilizes the [Coffee Ratings Dataset](coffee_ratings.csv)
 from [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), which contains detailed coffee quality ratings from the Coffee Quality Institute (CQI).

**Results**: Using Python functions, the analysis demonstrated that a versatile recommendation system can be built using linear algebra concepts.

### **Orbit: An AI-Powered Neurodivergent-Friendly Chatbot**  

Hackathon Submission for FemmeHacks at the University of Pennsylvania. Submission [here](https://devpost.com/software/adhd-w70jbo?_gl=1*cadw6*_gcl_au*MTE1MDkxNDYxLjE3NDAxNzM1MDM.*_ga*MTgyNjU4NTUzMS4xNzQwMTczNTA0*_ga_0YHJK3Y10M*MTc0MDE3MzUwNC4xLjEuMTc0MDE3NDIzOC4wLjAuMA..).

**Goal:**  This project aims to develop an **AI-powered chatbot** designed to support students with ADHD and neurodivergent tendencies by offering personalized productivity assistance.  

**Description:**  Orbit is a chatbot that enhances focus and productivity by adapting to different user needs. It features:  
- Low Stimulation Mode for a minimalist, distraction-free experience.  
- Dopamine Mode with colors, animations, and motivational messages.  
- Task prioritization using AI-powered smart sorting.  
- Break reminders, sticky notes, and a one-task-at-a-time view to reduce distractions.  

The chatbot was created to address gender disparities in ADHD diagnoses, particularly the tendency for women to be underdiagnosed due to their internally suppressive symptoms. By integrating AI, we sought to build a customizable, neurodivergent-friendly productivity tool.  

**Skills:**  AI Development, User-Centered Design, and Task Management Optimization.  

**Technology:**  Python, Streamlit, Google Gemini AI, Git, and GitHub.

**Results:**  The chatbot successfully provided adaptive productivity support, balancing focus and engagement through customizable modes. The project also improved our AI integration, UI/UX design, and collaborative coding skills.  


### Graph Theory and GitHub

**Presentation**: [Graph Theory and GitHub Poster](https://github.com/anggtellez16/Portfolio/blob/main/Graph%20Theory%20and%20GitHub%20Poster.pdf)


**Goal**: This research explores the fundamentals of graph theory and its application in GitHub’s version control system, demonstrating how directed graphs facilitate collaboration, project management, and software development.  

**Description**: This project examines how GitHub’s work tree applies graph theory to enable effective collaboration on complex projects. By visualizing commits as vertices and their relationships as directed edges, we demonstrate how GitHub systematically tracks project development. This structured approach, combined with a foundational understanding of graph theory, empowers professionals to manage projects efficiently, resolve conflicts, and maintain transparency in team-based environments.  

**Skills**: Graph Theory Fundamentals and Version Control Systems.

**Technology**: Python, Visual Studio Code, Git, and GitHub. 

**Results**: By applying graph theory concepts, the study demonstrated how directed graphs structure GitHub’s workflow, offering insights into optimizing repository management, improving team collaboration, and enhancing project transparency.
