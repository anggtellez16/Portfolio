# Angelica Tellez - Portfolio

## About 

Hi, I'm Angelica! I am currently on track to completing my degree in Applied Mathematics (BS) and Computer Science (AS). I have developed a strong foundation in coding and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I look forward to bringing my technical and analytical skills to the data science field as a data specialist.  

During my studies, I developed a strong ability to analyze complex data, identifying patterns and trends with precision. I also gained hands-on experience in research techniques, data management, and statistical analysisâ€”skills that will serve me well in my role as a data specialist.  

Beyond academics, I am passionate about exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, constantly seeking opportunities to expand my expertise. I thrive on uncovering valuable insights and using data to solve complex problems.

## Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Brewing Recommendations: A Data-Driven Approach to Coffee Recommendations Using Linear Algebra

Code: [Brewing Recommendations.ipynb](https://github.com/anggtellez16/Portfolio/blob/main/Brewing_Recommendations.ipynb)

Goal: To determine what factors contribute the most to a movie's success.

Description: This project explores the application of linear algebra to develop a personalized coffee recommendation system based on individual preferences. We created a mathematical model that uses these preferences to recommend five coffee beans tailored to specific users. Through this research, we demonstrate how linear algebra concepts (such as the dot product, vector normalization) can inform everyday choices, down to the specific coffee we enjoy. In the future, we aim to gather real user data to refine the model, ideally generating accurate recommendations with even fewer inputs.

Skills: data cleaning, data analysis, and correlation matrices.

Technology: Python, Pandas, and Numpy.

Results: Using Python functions, the analysis demonstrated that a versatile recommendation system can be built using linear algebra concepts.
